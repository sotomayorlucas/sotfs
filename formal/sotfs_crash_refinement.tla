\* TLA+ Specification: sotFS Crash Refinement Simulation Proof (R_crash)
\*
\* Formalizes the refinement relation R_crash between the WAL-based
\* concrete implementation and the abstract key-value store specification.
\* This is the TLA+ encoding of Definition 3.1 (Crash Refinement) from
\* the sotX paper (Section 3.2, Layer 2).
\*
\* Structure:
\*   - Abstract spec: atomic key-value store (AbsWrite, AbsCrash)
\*   - Concrete spec: WAL-based store (WalAppend, WalCommit, WalCrash,
\*     WalRecover) from sotfs_crash.tla
\*   - Refinement mapping R_crash: maps concrete states to abstract states
\*   - Simulation theorem: ConcreteSpec => AbstractSpec (refinement check)
\*
\* Properties verified:
\*   - RefinementHolds: every concrete behavior maps to an abstract behavior
\*   - RecoveryIsIdempotent: recover(recover(s)) = recover(s)
\*   - NoIntermediateStates: post-recovery store is fully pre-tx or post-commit
\*   - CommitIsAtomic: uncommitted -> committed in a single step

\* PART I: Abstract Specification (Key-Value Store)
\* =====================================================================
\*
\* The abstract spec models a simple key-value store where writes are
\* atomic and crashes are no-ops (the store is always consistent).
\* This is the "ideal" view that clients observe.

\* PART II: Refinement Mapping R_crash
\* =====================================================================
\*
\* R_crash maps a concrete state to the abstract state that a client
\* would observe. The key insight (from Yggdrasil/FSCQ):
\*
\*   - If walCommitted = TRUE: the transaction is logically complete,
\*     so the abstract store reflects the post-commit values.
\*   - If walCommitted = FALSE: the transaction has not committed,
\*     so the abstract store reflects the pre-transaction values.
\*
\* This captures the fundamental WAL guarantee: a crash at any point
\* results in either the old state or the new state, never a mix.
\* =====================================================================

\* Apply a WAL log to a store, producing the post-commit store.

\* correspond to?

\* =====================================================================
\* PART VII: Safety Properties
\* =====================================================================

\* --- Property 1: Refinement Holds ---
\* The abstract store always equals R_crash(concrete_state) when the
\* system is quiescent (no active transaction, or after crash+recovery).
\* During an active transaction, the abstract store tracks the
\* pre-transaction state (if uncommitted) or post-commit state (if
\* committed).
RefinementHolds ==
    \* After recovery, abstract store equals the recovered concrete store
    walRecovered
    => absStore = concreteStore

\* --- Property 2: Recovery Is Idempotent ---
\* Recovering twice gives the same result as recovering once.
\* Encoded as: after recovery, if we were to recover again (which the
\* spec prevents), the store would not change. We verify this by checking
\* that after recovery, the concrete store already matches what replay
\* would produce.
RecoveryIsIdempotent ==
    walRecovered
    => \* WAL is cleared after recovery, so replaying empty WAL is identity
       /\ walLog = <<>>
       /\ walCommitted = FALSE
       /\ concreteStore = walMemStore

\* --- Property 3: No Intermediate States ---
\* After crash+recovery, the store is either fully pre-transaction
\* (rollback) or fully post-commit (replay). Never a partial mix.
NoIntermediateStates ==
    \* After recovery, the concrete store is either at the pre-tx
    \* snapshot (rollback) or at the post-commit value (replay).
    \* We use absStore as the post-commit ground truth instead of
    \* ApplyWalLog(walLog), because Recover clears walLog -- after
    \* recovery the only authoritative record of "what would have
    \* happened" is the abstract store the simulation already updated
    \* at WalCommit.
    walRecovered
    => \/ concreteStore = walPreStore   \* full rollback
       \/ concreteStore = absStore      \* full replay (matches post-commit)

\* --- Property 4: Commit Is Atomic ---
\* The transition from uncommitted to committed happens in exactly one
\* step (WalCommit). We verify this as: walCommitted can only become
\* TRUE when it was previously FALSE (single flip).
CommitIsAtomic ==
    \* walCommitted is FALSE initially and after finalize/recovery.
    \* It becomes TRUE exactly once per transaction (in WalCommit).
    \* Verify: when walCommitted is TRUE, the abstract store reflects
    \* all WAL entries (the commit took effect atomically).
    walCommitted
    => absStore = ApplyWalLog(absPreStore, walLog)

\* --- Gluing invariant: ties concrete and abstract state together ---
\* This is the core simulation invariant. It says that R_crash faithfully
\* tracks the abstract store at all times.
GluingInvariant ==
    \* When no transaction is active and no crash has occurred,
    \* abstract and concrete stores agree.
    (~walTxActive /\ ~walCrashed /\ ~absTxActive)
    => absStore = concreteStore

\* --- Concrete invariant: walMemStore tracks in-flight writes ---
ConcreteConsistency ==
    (walTxActive /\ walCommitted /\ ~walCrashed)
    => walMemStore = ApplyWalLog(walPreStore, walLog)
